        <h4>History Of Wine</h4>
        <p>
        The earliest known traces of wine are from Georgia (c. 6000 BCE),Iran (Persia) (c. 5000 BCE), and Sicily (c. 4000 BCE). 
        Wine reached the Balkans by 4500 BC and was consumed and celebrated in ancient Greece, Thrace and Rome. Throughout history, 
        wine has been consumed for its intoxicating effects.
        The earliest archaeological and archaeobotanical evidence for grape wine and viniculture, dating to 6000-5800 BCE was found on the 
        territory of modern Georgia.Both archaeological and genetic evidence suggest that the earliest production of wine elsewhere was 
        relatively later, likely having taken place in the Southern Caucasus
        (which encompasses Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan), or the West Asian region between Eastern Turkey, and northern Iran.
        The earliest known winery from 4100 BCE is the Areni-1 winery in Armenia.
        Although not wine, the earliest evidence of grape and rice mixed based fermented drinks were found in ancient China (c. 7000 BCE),
        Detail of a relief of the eastern stairs of the Apadana, Persepolis, depicting Armenians bringing an amphora, probably of wine, 
        to the king A 2003 report by archaeologists indicates a possibility that grapes were mixed with rice to produce mixed fermented
        drinks in ancient China in the early years of the seventh millennium BCE. Pottery jars from the Neolithic site of Jiahu, Henan,
        contained traces of tartaric acid and other organic compounds commonly found in wine. However, other fruits indigenous to the region, 
        such as hawthorn, cannot be ruled out.If these drinks, which seem to be the precursors of rice wine, included grapes rather than other
        fruits, they would have been any of the several dozen indigenous wild species in China, rather than Vitis vinifera, which was 
        introduced 6000 years later.
        The spread of wine culture westwards was most probably due to the Phoenicians who spread outward from a base of city-states along 
        the Mediterranean coast centered around modern day Lebanon (as well as including small parts of Israel/Palestine and coastal Syria)
        ;however, the Nuragic culture in Sardinia already had a custom of consuming wine before the arrival of the Phoenicians. The wines of
        Byblos were exported to Egypt during the Old Kingdom and then throughout the Mediterranean <strong>(Source:Wikipedia).</strong>

                        <h3>Extreme value Wine</h3>
                          <p> 
                             The lowest quality tier “Extreme Value Wine” includes some familiar labels such as Gallo Family Vineyards,
                             Sutter Home, Crane Lake (Bronco Wine Co), Tisdale (a Gallo brand),
                             Rex Goliath (Constellation Wine brand) and several bag-in-a-box brands (with a cost per bottle below four dollars).
                          </p>

                        <h3>Value</h3>
                            <p> 
                             On the higher side of the value spectrum (the $9-$10 mark) is where you'll find the beginnings of quality.
                             The higher tier value wines are mostly from large US, French, and Italian wineries that focus on good baseline quality
                             wine for everyday drinking. 
                            </p>

                        <h3>Popular Premium</h3>
                           <p> 
                             This is the sweet spot for most US wine buyers. Premium isn't a fair name for this category,
                             and we like to think of it more like the “Baseline Typicity” wine. Also, the premium category is a bit
                             of a misnomer because, on the one hand, you can find quite a few decent varietal wines from good large-
                             production wineries 
                           </p>

                        <h3>Premium</h3>
                           <p> 
                             Premiums are good, solid quality wines with both typicity and the beginnings of terroir.
                             The premium wine category seems to be the true start of high-quality winemaking.
                           </p>

                        <h3>Super Premium</h3>
                            <p> 
                             The super premium wine category is the entry-level for great handmade wines from medium to
                             large production wineries. Also, this price point affords good quality for in-demand wine varieties 
                             (e.g., Pinot Noir). Expect terroir, typicity, and an element of craft in this category.

                             Ultra Premiums are great-quality, excellent-tasting, cellar-worthy wines from producers 
                             of all sizes. Beyond this price point is where wine prices become a diminishing return to
                             buy wines from in-demand wine regions (e.g., Napa Valley, Bordeaux, Barbaresco) or in-demand 
                             wineries.
